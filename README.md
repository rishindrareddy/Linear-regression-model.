# Linear-regression-model.

Machine learning model for linear regression, includes models for multiple variable model and polynomial regression model.

In this experiment, we: 
1. optimized the cost function to fit in with training data by addressing under-fitting and over-fitting problems. 
2. used gradient descent to minimize the error and increase accuracy of the model.
3. used feature normalization technique for improving efficiency of the algorithm.
